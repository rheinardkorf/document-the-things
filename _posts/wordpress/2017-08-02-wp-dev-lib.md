To better understand the goodies included in <https://github.com/xwp/wp-dev-lib> I'm disecting the folder
structure and highlighting a few key components used.

```bash

The *wp-dev-lib* library has support for the following tools:

* [Coveralls](https:/coveralls.io) - For code test coverage.
* [.editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org) - For consistent editor code styling.
* [ESLint](http://eslint.org) - For JavaScript linting.
* [JSCS (now part of ESLint)](https://medium.com/@markelog/jscs-end-of-the-line-bc9bf0b3fdb2) - For JavaScript style checking.
* [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) - For JavaScript linting.
* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) - For continious integration checking. Free for Open Source with GitHub and Coveralls integration.
* [PHPCS](http://www.squizlabs.com/php-codesniffer) - For sniffing out code standards violations.
* [WPCS (WordPress Coding Standards)](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards) - PHPCS rules for WordPress Coding Standards.
* [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) - For unit testing PHP. Configuration for wp-dev-lib is WordPress Core Tests friendly. But needs some tweaking if not running through Travis and/or VVV.

`pre-commit` checks JSHint, JSCS, ESLint in that order depending on config variables. ESLint is winnign favour, but JSHint is hanging in there. JSCS is now part of ESLint. Its a good idea to set config variables so that only one of these run.

Checkout the <https://github.com/xwp/wp-dev-lib> for instructions on setting up and using the toolset provided.
